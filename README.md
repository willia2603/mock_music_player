# Description
The idea of this project is for me to learn the basics of vue, react, jinja and flask by mocking a spotify-like music player. The files (music, images etc) have not been uploaded due to upload restictions. They can be added manually in their relative folders (`music`, `images` folders). 

# Setup
For the app to work, flask, must be run by entering the folder `flask` and run `flask run`. To properly run flask, install the packages found in the file `requirements.txt`. In another terminal, change to the `vue` folder or `react-app` folder, and run `npm run dev` for the former and `npm start` for the latter.
