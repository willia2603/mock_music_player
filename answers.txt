PROJECT 2
Task 1:
1. why venv? Why requirements.txt is needed? -> we use venv to create a virtual environment in which we can install all our packages, to ensure that the libraries are consistent and easily allow third parties to properly run our app
-> requirements.txt is needed to know which libraries have been installed, so that they can be installed again and ensure the app is run with consistent library versions.
2. why __init__.py? What is it used for? Why is here necessary? -> to make python recognize the folder as a module. According to the internet, it's not needed with python 3.3+ (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages)
